# exifgc - exif gps check

Simple command line tool to check if images in a given directory have gps coordinates assigned in their exif metadata.

The main use case that led me to develop this tool is the following:

As an author posting content to the internet, that at times may include
pictures taken at my place of residence or any other sensitive location,
I want a quick way to verify
that none of the pictures in a given directory contain the coordinates to
the location.
